# Boid Simulation

A Python implementation of Craig Reynolds' Boids algorithm, simulating flocking behavior of birds.

## Description

This project simulates the emergent flocking behavior of birds (boids) using three simple rules:
- **Separation**: Steer to avoid crowding local flockmates
- **Alignment**: Steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
- **Cohesion**: Steer to move toward the average position of local flockmates

## Installation

```

## Usage

```

## Requirements
